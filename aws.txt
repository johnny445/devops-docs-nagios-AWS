 GIT Branching strategy
 
 master branch - stable (production code)
 development branch - pre production code
 feature branch - 
 release branch - preperation of new production release
 hot fix - patch production releases

 NGINX - It accelerates content and application delivery, improves security, 
 facilitates availability and scalability for the busiest web sites on the Internet.
 The NGINX source code is written in the C programming language.
Declarative pipeline:
The Declarative pipeline is a new feature that is added to create the pipeline. 
This is basically written in a Jenkinsfile which can be stored into a source code management system such as Git. 
Declarative pipelines is an ideal solution for the simple continuous delivery pipeline as it has very limited and pre-defined structure.

Scripted pipeline:
The scripted pipeline is a traditional way of writing the Jenkins pipeline as code. 
Ideally, a Scripted pipeline is written in the Jenkins file on the web UI of Jenkins. 
Unlike the Declarative pipeline, the scripted pipeline strictly uses groovy based syntax. 
Since this, The scripted pipeline provides huge control over the script and can manipulate the flow of the script extensively. 
This helps developers to develop advance and complex pipelines as code.
