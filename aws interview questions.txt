1. DEFINE AND EXPLAIN THE THREE BASIC TYPES OF CLOUD SERVICES AND THE AWS PRODUCTS THAT ARE BUILT BASED ON THEM?
THE THREE BASIC TYPES OF CLOUD SERVICES ARE:

1.COMPUTING
2.STORAGE
3.NETWORKING

HERE ARE SOME OF THE AWS PRODUCTS THAT ARE BUILT BASED ON THE THREE CLOUD SERVICE TYPES:
COMPUTING - THESE INCLUDE EC2, ELASTIC BEANSTALK, LAMBDA, AUTO-SCALING, AND LIGHTSAT.
STORAGE - THESE INCLUDE S3, GLACIER, ELASTIC BLOCK STORAGE, ELASTIC FILE SYSTEM.
NETWORKING - THESE INCLUDE VPC, AMAZON CLOUDFRONT, ROUTE53.

2.WHAT IS AUTO-SCALING?
	
AUTO-SCALING IS A FUNCTION THAT ALLOWS YOU TO PROVISION AND LAUNCH NEW INSTANCES WHENEVER THERE IS A DEMAND. 
IT ALLOWS YOU TO AUTOMATICALLY INCREASE OR DECREASE RESOURCE CAPACITY IN RELATION TO THE DEMAND.

3.WHAT IS GEO-TARGETING IN CLOUDFRONT?

GEO-TARGETING IS A CONCEPT WHERE BUSINESSES CAN SHOW PERSONALIZED CONTENT TO THEIR AUDIENCE BASED ON THEIR GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION WITHOUT CHANGING THE URL. 
THIS HELPS YOU CREATE CUSTOMIZED CONTENT FOR THE AUDIENCE OF A SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHICAL AREA, KEEPING THEIR NEEDS IN THE FOREFRONT.

4. CAN YOU HOST DYNAMIC WEBSITES ON S3?. WHAT ABOUT STATIC WEBSITES?

YOU CAN USE S3 TO HOST STATIC WEBSITES SUCH AS . HTML WEBSITES, DYNAMIC WEBSITES CANNOT BE HOSTED ON S3."

WHAT IS CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION?

IN CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION AFTER A CODE COMMIT, THE SOFTWARE IS BUILT AND TESTED IMMEDIATELY. 
IN A LARGE PROJECT WITH MANY DEVELOPERS, COMMITS ARE MADE MANY TIMES DURING A DAY. WITH EACH COMMIT CODE IS BUILT AND TESTED. 
IF THE TEST IS PASSED, BUILD IS TESTED FOR DEPLOYMENT. IF DEPLOYMENT IS A SUCCESS, THE CODE IS PUSHED TO PRODUCTION. 
THIS COMMIT, BUILD, TEST, AND DEPLOY IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS AND HENCE THE NAME CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION/DEPLOYMENT.

BOTH ENTRYPOINT AND CMD ALLOW YOU TO SPECIFY THE STARTUP COMMAND FOR AN IMAGE.
HOW TO USE ENTRYPOINT OR CMD TO SPECIFY YOUR IMAGE'S DEFAULT EXECUTABLE. HOWEVER, 
THERE ARE SOME CASES WHERE IT MAKES SENSE TO USE ENTRYPOINT AND CMD TOGETHER.

GIT:

Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, 
so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. 
Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.


SOURCE COMMAND FOR UPDATE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES

SOURCE ~/.BASH_PROFILE

YUM LIST AVAILABLE JAVA\*  -- TO SHOW MULTIPLE JAVA VERSIONS AND INSTALL JAVA. 

ALTERNATIVES --CONFIG JAVA  -- TO SELECT WHICH JAVA VERSION IS USED TO UR APPLICATION.

DOCKERFILE:

ADD copies the files from a source on the host into the containerâ€™s own filesystem at the set destination.
CMD can be used for executing a specific command within the container.
ENTRYPOINT sets a default application to be used every time a container is created with the image.
ENV sets environment variables.
EXPOSE associates a specific port to enable networking between the container and the outside world.
FROM defines the base image used to start the build process.
MAINTAINER defines a full name and email address of the image creator.
RUN is the central executing directive for Dockerfiles.
USER sets the UID (or username) which is to run the container.
VOLUME is used to enable access from the container to a directory on the host machine.
WORKDIR sets the path where the command, defined with CMD, is to be executed.
LABEL allows you to add a label to your docker image.
